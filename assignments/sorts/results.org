Merge sort was better then the first quick sort when the amount of items was much higher. But The second quick sort was almost infintely quicker then the others. It was able to sort 10 the items of what the first quick sort sorted 10 times quicker. It seemed like changing the pivot did not have as much effect as I thought it would.
